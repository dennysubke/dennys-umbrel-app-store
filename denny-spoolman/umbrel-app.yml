  🧵 Spoolman is a modern open source application that helps makers organize and track their 3D printing filament collection with precision and ease. It provides a clear way to record important details about each spool such as material type, color, brand, weight, and remaining amount. The app automatically keeps your inventory up to date as you print, removing the need for manual calculations or guesswork.


  It is designed to make filament management effortless for both hobbyists and professionals who want reliable data about their supplies. By maintaining accurate information about every spool, users can plan prints better, avoid running out of material, and reduce waste. Spoolman turns filament tracking into a simple and enjoyable part of the 3D printing process, keeping every project organized from start to finish.
