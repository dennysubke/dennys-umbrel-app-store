  📊 Medama Analytics is a privacy focused analytics platform designed to give clear insight into how people interact with a website while avoiding intrusive data collection. It focuses on simplicity and clarity by tracking only the essential interaction events that matter for understanding user behavior. The tracking script is extremely lightweight and does not rely on cookies or personal identifiers, which makes the analytics feel clean, transparent and respectful of user privacy.


  The application provides real time visibility into visits and interactions, allowing you to observe activity the moment it happens. Its data model is intentionally minimal so that the information you receive is easy to interpret without being overwhelmed by noise. Events such as page views, navigation flows and custom actions can be captured and viewed in a focused interface that highlights what is important.


  Medama Analytics also exposes an accessible API that allows developers to fetch analytics data and use it in their own dashboards or tools. This makes it flexible for integrating analytical insights into other workflows. Overall, the application delivers modern lightweight analytics with an emphasis on speed, clarity and privacy, giving you a straightforward view of how your audience uses your website.
