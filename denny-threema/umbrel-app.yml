  ðŸ“± Threema Web is a secure and convenient way to use the Threema messaging app directly from a web browser while maintaining full end-to-end encryption. By scanning a QR code with the Threema app, users establish a direct connection between their smartphone and computer, ensuring that no messages or metadata are stored on external servers. The communication is handled via WebRTC, which enables a private and encrypted peer-to-peer connection.


  With Threema Web, users can send and receive messages, share images and files, and manage conversations with the comfort of a full-sized keyboard and larger screen. Since all data remains on the userâ€™s devices and is never uploaded to the cloud, Threema Web offers a high level of privacy and security. This makes it an ideal solution for those who want a seamless messaging experience across devices without sacrificing confidentiality.
