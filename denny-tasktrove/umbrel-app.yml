  ✔️ TaskTrove is a modern task management application designed to help people organize their daily work and personal projects with clarity and efficiency. It provides a clean and intuitive interface where tasks can be quickly added, edited, and managed. The application supports natural language input so due dates, reminders, and scheduling details can be written in everyday language and immediately transformed into structured information. Tasks can be grouped into projects and further refined with labels, subtasks, and recurring patterns, making it easy to manage both simple to do lists and more complex workflows.


  TaskTrove offers multiple ways to view and interact with tasks including a traditional list view, a compact view for dense overviews, and a Kanban style board that is especially useful for visual organization and progress tracking. Searching and filtering are central features, allowing users to focus only on what is relevant at a given moment without losing sight of the bigger picture. Upcoming additions such as calendar integration and analytical tools extend its ability to provide insights into productivity and time management.


  The application is built with privacy in mind and avoids unnecessary tracking or telemetry. It encourages a personal and distraction free workflow where the user stays in full control of their information. Its flexibility makes it suitable for different styles of productivity whether that means a simple checklist for everyday errands or a structured system for managing multiple projects at once.
