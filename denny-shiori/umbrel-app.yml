  🔖 Shiori is a lightweight and elegant bookmark manager that helps you collect and organize your favorite websites in one place. It is designed for people who want to save useful articles, resources, and references without relying on external services. Every time you save a link, Shiori automatically fetches its title, description, and metadata to make your collection both structured and easy to browse.


  Beyond simple bookmarking, Shiori allows you to store readable versions of pages so you can revisit the content even when the original site is unavailable. This makes it perfect for research, long-term reference collections, or simply building your personal digital library. You can add tags, edit details, and search your saved content with fast, responsive filters that make finding information effortless.


  The interface is clean and distraction-free, focusing entirely on your saved content. Shiori aims to make managing bookmarks as natural and intuitive as possible while preserving the flexibility and control that power users appreciate. It turns your bookmarks into a personal archive that is searchable, reliable, and fully under your control.
