  🎮 Gameyfin is an open source platform designed to organize and manage personal video game collections. It scans local directories to automatically detect games and compiles them into a unified digital library. Each entry is enriched with metadata such as titles, descriptions, genres, and cover art, creating a visually appealing catalog that helps users rediscover and browse their games effortlessly.


  The system is built to be lightweight and efficient, ensuring that even large collections can be indexed and displayed quickly. It retrieves information from online databases to provide accurate details and consistent artwork, reducing the need for manual input. Users can explore their entire game library through a simple web interface that supports searching, sorting, and viewing individual game pages with detailed information.


  Gameyfin focuses on giving players control over their digital libraries, offering a structured way to access and manage owned games. It does not distribute or emulate games but instead provides a private and organized environment for keeping track of them. By combining automation, clean presentation, and customization, it transforms a folder of scattered files into a cohesive and accessible personal archive of interactive entertainment.


  ⚙️ Place simple text files directly inside ${APP_DATA_DIR}/data/games, each named after a game you’d like to appear in your library, such as “Super Mario 64.txt” or “Portal 2.txt”. When you add this path as a library in Gameyfin and run a rescan, the app will automatically detect these files as game entries, allowing you to explore and test your library without needing any actual game files.
