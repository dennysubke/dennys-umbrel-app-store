  ðŸŽ® Gameyfin is an open source platform designed to organize and manage personal video game collections. It scans local directories to automatically detect games and compiles them into a unified digital library. Each entry is enriched with metadata such as titles, descriptions, genres, and cover art, creating a visually appealing catalog that helps users rediscover and browse their games effortlessly.


  The system is built to be lightweight and efficient, ensuring that even large collections can be indexed and displayed quickly. It retrieves information from online databases to provide accurate details and consistent artwork, reducing the need for manual input. Users can explore their entire game library through a simple web interface that supports searching, sorting, and viewing individual game pages with detailed information.


  Gameyfin focuses on giving players control over their digital libraries, offering a structured way to access and manage owned games. It does not distribute or emulate games but instead provides a private and organized environment for keeping track of them. By combining automation, clean presentation, and customization, it transforms a folder of scattered files into a cohesive and accessible personal archive of interactive entertainment.

  Version 2.1.2 is a bugfix release that prepares the database for future updates. It removes leftover indexes, cleans up unused and corrupted images, and improves image handling. This will be the last minor release on Docker Hub, so users should switch to the new image at ghcr.io/gameyfin/gameyfin and back up their data before updating.
