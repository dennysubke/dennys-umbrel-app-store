Additionally, Postiz includes a built-in graphic design tool, similar to Canva, which enables users to create visually appealing images and graphics for their posts, further simplifying the content creation process.


  The platform also facilitates team collaboration, making it ideal for businesses or agencies with multiple team members. Users can assign tasks, share content drafts, and plan content calendars together, ensuring that the entire team is aligned on social media strategies. Postiz's analytics features provide users with detailed insights into the performance of their posts, helping them refine their strategies based on engagement data and reach.


  Postiz supports a wide range of social media platforms, including both well-known networks like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, as well as emerging platforms like Mastodon and Bluesky. This extensive platform support allows users to manage all their social media accounts from a single dashboard, saving time and effort in switching between different tools and services.


  The platform is offered in various pricing tiers to cater to different needs, from individual content creators to large agencies. Each plan includes different levels of access to features such as the number of social media channels, posts, and AI-generated images available per month, with more advanced features available in higher-priced plans.
