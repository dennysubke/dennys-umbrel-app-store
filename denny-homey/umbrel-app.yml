  Homey is a smart home automation platform that brings all connected devices together into one unified system and allows users to control, monitor, and automate their home in a simple and powerful way. The app connects devices from many different brands and ecosystems and presents them in a single interface, removing the need to switch between multiple manufacturer apps.


  Homey focuses strongly on automation through its visual flow system, which lets users create advanced logic based on triggers, conditions, and actions. Devices can react automatically to events such as time schedules, sensor changes, presence detection, or external data like weather and energy usage. These automations can range from simple actions such as turning lights on and off to complex scenarios that coordinate multiple devices across different rooms.


  The app also provides real time device status, dashboards, and detailed insights into energy consumption, making it easier to understand how devices behave and how energy is used in the household. Users can monitor power usage, identify patterns, and optimize automations to reduce consumption and increase efficiency. Voice assistant integrations and mobile notifications allow quick interaction and feedback, ensuring that users stay informed and in control at all times.


  Overall, Homey acts as a central brain for the smart home, unifying device management, automation, and insights into one coherent experience that prioritizes flexibility, interoperability, and ease of use.

releaseNotes: >-
  This version introduces a new Flow action that allows users to reply with text directly to push notifications sent by Homey, making interactions more dynamic and responsive.


  Camera streaming has been improved, with the Virtual IP Camera now supporting all available video types except WebRTC. Several device and RF related fixes also improve accuracy, including corrected floating point behavior and more reliable RF signal handling.


  Additionally, issues with Matter Flow cards not appearing correctly in the Web App have been resolved, and a Z Wave fix prevents excessive network traffic that could cause certain devices to become unavailable. The update is rounded out with general core improvements and updated translations.
