  ðŸ¦« BeaverHabits is a habit tracking app designed to support consistency and mindfulness in daily routines. Instead of pushing users toward fixed goals or productivity metrics, it encourages a gentle, repetition-based approach to habit formation. The app centers around the idea that long-term change comes from showing up every day, even if progress is gradual. It allows users to track a wide range of habits - whether simple daily tasks, wellness activities, or creative practices and gives a clear visual overview of what has been completed and what still needs attention.


  Users can define custom schedules for each habit, such as specific days of the week or intervals like every three days. This flexibility makes it easy to tailor the experience to individual rhythms and preferences. The interface is clean, focused, and free from distractions, placing emphasis on the actual act of tracking rather than overwhelming users with stats or gamification. Over time, users can spot patterns, maintain streaks, and develop a deeper awareness of their behavior.


  BeaverHabits is ideal for anyone looking to build structure, maintain balance, or bring more intention into their daily life. Whether you're trying to drink more water, meditate regularly, or simply remember to stretch, it provides a simple and effective way to stay on track.
