  🔍 Lunalytics offers a rich set of features designed to give you full visibility into the health of your services. It continuously monitors HTTP and TCP endpoints and provides detailed uptime and latency statistics with precise response time tracking.


  The tool also includes automatic TLS certificate monitoring so you are alerted before certificates expire or become invalid. This helps prevent unexpected downtime caused by certificate issues.


  Each monitored endpoint can be configured with custom intervals, tags, and descriptions, allowing for flexible organization and categorization. You can group services by project, type, or any other criteria that fits your workflow.


  The built-in alerting system notifies you when a service goes down or shows abnormal behavior so you can react immediately. Alerts are sent only when they matter to avoid unnecessary noise.


  Lunalytics supports multiple users with role based access control, enabling teams to share dashboards while maintaining permission boundaries. Admins can invite users and assign roles to manage access levels effectively.


  All monitoring data is displayed in real time through an intuitive and interactive dashboard. Historical charts and request logs allow for deeper analysis and help you spot trends or recurring issues over time.
