It allows users to create, edit, and manage notes using an extended Markdown syntax that combines the simplicity of plain text with the richness of formatted writing. Notes can include headings, code blocks, tables, images, and other elements that make complex ideas easy to structure and read.


  The interface focuses on clarity and comfort, offering a clean writing environment that encourages focus and creativity. Every note can be quickly accessed, searched, and categorized, allowing users to build a personal knowledge base that grows naturally over time. Alexandrie supports a fluid writing experience where text flows smoothly, formatting feels intuitive, and users can stay fully immersed in their thoughts without distractions.


  Its design philosophy revolves around helping people think clearly through writing. Whether capturing fleeting ideas, developing detailed documents, or drafting long-form articles, Alexandrie turns the process into something fluid and rewarding. It is not just a place to store notes but a tool to refine, connect, and expand them into a coherent body of work.

releaseNotes: >-
  This version of Alexandrie introduces several major improvements and refinements across the platform. The MinIO storage system has been replaced with RufusFS to provide better performance, stability, and compatibility with the backend.


  The landing page has been completely redesigned to include a live demo of core features and to properly display contributor profile images from GitHub. A new Markdown syntax component has been introduced, adding support for colored info containers and mathematical notation using $$, giving users more flexibility when writing advanced notes.


  The update also enhances usability with a search bar in the CDN component, a cleaner dark theme, and an improved logout system that allows signing out from all devices. Security has been strengthened with an HTML sanitizer to protect against XSS attacks.


  In addition, numerous fixes improve responsiveness on mobile, align Markdown columns more neatly, and resolve issues with dark mode synchronization, PWA installation, and backend bucket policies. The documentation and README have been updated with clearer instructions and new visuals, rounding out a polished and reliable release.
