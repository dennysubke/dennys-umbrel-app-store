  🚀 Rocket.Chat is a comprehensive real time communication platform that unifies conversations, collaboration, and knowledge sharing in a single digital workspace. It provides a familiar chat experience with individual and group conversations, persistent channels for focused topics, and threaded replies that keep discussions organized even when many participants are involved. Users can exchange text, images, videos, voice messages, and files of all types, making it a flexible communication hub for both short quick messages and more structured project discussions.


  Beyond basic messaging, Rocket.Chat includes powerful collaboration features that help teams stay productive. Video and voice calls can be launched directly from a conversation, making it simple to switch from text to a face to face style discussion without leaving the platform. Screen sharing enhances teamwork on presentations, troubleshooting sessions, or planning tasks. Built in mentions, message reactions, read receipts, and link previews make communication feel modern and intuitive, while message search and filtering allow users to quickly find past information and keep track of important details.


  To support automation and connected workflows, Rocket.Chat offers integrations with popular services, flexible webhooks, and an extensible bot framework that can respond to commands, send alerts, and assist with daily routines. Custom slash commands, custom emojis, flexible UI themes, and user level personalization options create a familiar and enjoyable space that adapts to different teams and communication cultures. Administrators can configure detailed access controls, retain full oversight of conversation management, and tailor the platform to the needs of small groups, large organizations, or community environments.


  Overall, Rocket.Chat provides a secure and adaptable communication experience that combines modern chat functionality with advanced collaboration tools. It supports casual team conversations, structured project work, and community engagement in one place, helping people stay connected, informed, and productive while maintaining full control over the messaging environment.

releaseNotes: >-
  The latest update introduces several usability and security improvements, including a new range input for settings, safer permission handling with a warning modal, enhancements to voice calls with clearer transfer information and improved dial tone feedback, and an expandable message composer as a preview feature. The Apps Engine also receives an experimental API to retrieve a user’s room list, offering more flexibility for extensions and automation.


  Additionally, this release resolves a wide range of bugs, improving stability and reliability across the platform. Fixes address issues affecting encrypted messaging, permissions, monitoring charts, omnichannel translations, notification handling, volume controls, and user management. Crashes have been prevented in multiple areas, calls can no longer start in archived rooms, and protection has been added to avoid accidental deletion of core rooms.
