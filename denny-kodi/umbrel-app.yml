  Kodi Headless is a version of Kodi that operates without a graphical user interface. It is primarily used when Kodi is intended to function as a central media server, running in the background without the need for a screen or direct user interaction. This means Kodi can automatically update and manage the media library without requiring the user to interact with the usual visual interface.


  This setup is especially useful for users who want to make their media collection accessible on multiple devices. By using Kodi Headless, a central database for the media library can be utilized, which can be accessed by multiple Kodi clients simultaneously. This makes it easier to manage the media library and keep it synchronized across different devices, as all clients display the same library.


  Another advantage of Kodi Headless is its lower resource consumption compared to the standard Kodi installation with a graphical interface. Since no interface needs to be rendered, Kodi Headless is particularly resource-efficient and works well on low-power devices like the Raspberry Pi or in Docker containers. This allows Kodi to serve as a backend server that streams media to other devices on the network, while the user interface is rendered on those devices.


  Overall, Kodi Headless is an ideal solution for users who want centralized media management and distribution without constantly interacting with the graphical user interface of Kodi.
