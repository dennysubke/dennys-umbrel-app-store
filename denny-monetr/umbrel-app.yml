  💸 Monetr is a personal finance application that helps users understand their spending and manage their money with clarity. It focuses on presenting a clear picture of available funds by showing how much remains after accounting for upcoming expenses and savings goals. The application allows users to organise their finances around real obligations and planned costs rather than relying on a simple monthly view. It supports recurring expenses of any interval and uses these to calculate what must be set aside so that future payments are always covered.


  Monetr provides tools to categorise transactions, track spending patterns and manage budgets in a way that adapts to individual financial habits. It allows users to build an accurate overview of their financial commitments and ensures that both regular and irregular payments are reflected in their balance. The system encourages a realistic approach to budgeting by helping users allocate money intentionally and avoid unexpected shortfalls.


  Through its design, monetr aims to make personal financial planning more predictable and less stressful by giving users a structured and transparent view of their finances.

releaseNotes: >-
  This version introduces improved handling of similar transactions and expands the transaction details view while refining date formatting and loading behaviour. It also integrates the react compiler into the frontend build and moves several components to lazy or asynchronous loading to enhance performance.


  This update includes a broad set of dependency upgrades to keep both the API and UI modern and stable.


  It also fixes a wide range of visual and functional issues, including badge styling, icon rendering, checkbox descriptions, login validation and sidebar text behaviour. Several loading states and interaction elements were corrected for a smoother user experience.


  The release further contains extensive refactoring work. Many components were migrated to css modules, unused code was removed and various UI elements were restructured for cleaner design and better maintainability.
