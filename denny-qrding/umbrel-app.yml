  QRding is a selfhosted application that allows users to generate QR codes through a clean and intuitive web interface. Developed by Rishikanth Chandrasekaran, the project focuses on providing a flexible and privacyfriendly way to create various types of QR codes without relying on thirdparty services. QRding supports different templates such as WiFi credentials, vCard contact information, calendar events, plain text, and URLs. Users can customize the appearance of their codes by adjusting size and colors to fit their needs.


  The application is designed with future extensibility in mind. Planned features include persistent storage for generated codes, webhook support, and integrations with popular platforms like Home Assistant and Discord. These integrations aim to turn QRding into more than just a static generator by enabling use cases such as automations, event reminders, and even smart home triggers. The developer also engages actively with the community and has already implemented requested features such as the ability to add text labels beneath QR codes.


  QRding is an ideal solution for users who want a locally hosted QR code generator that respects their privacy and allows for creative use cases. Whether it is to share WiFi credentials with guests, distribute digital business cards, or automate everyday tasks, QRding provides a lightweight and powerful tool that is actively maintained and continually evolving.
