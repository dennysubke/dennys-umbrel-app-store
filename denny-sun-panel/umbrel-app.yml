  🌞 Sun Panel is a clean and visually pleasing homepage and application dashboard designed to bring structure and simplicity to environments with many services. It presents all available applications and links in an elegant grid and allows the user to organize them into meaningful categories. Each tile can display custom icons, colors, labels or status indicators, which makes the entire interface feel personal and easy to navigate. The panel also offers a lightweight monitoring view that shows essential system information such as performance metrics or service activity in real time, giving users a quick overview of what is happening behind the scenes.


  A central part of Sun Panel is its focus on convenience. It provides a smooth way to add, edit or reorder entries so users can shape the homepage exactly how they want it. Custom scripts, themes and small visual adjustments can be applied to match personal style preferences. Sun Panel aims to remove clutter and present a single unified doorway to all tools and services a person uses regularly. Everything is placed in one polished interface that is easy to access and pleasant to look at. The experience is intentionally simple and friendly while still offering enough flexibility for individual customization.
