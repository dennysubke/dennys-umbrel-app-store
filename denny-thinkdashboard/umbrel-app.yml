  🔢 ThinkDashboard is an open source web application created to help users organize and access their favorite websites from a single elegant dashboard. It provides a clean and minimal interface that removes distractions and focuses entirely on usability and speed. The main goal of ThinkDashboard is to offer a simple yet powerful space where users can keep all their important links in one central place.


  At its core, ThinkDashboard functions as a personal homepage for bookmarks. Users can create and arrange links into custom categories, making it easy to switch between collections such as work tools, news sources, or entertainment pages. Each link can be opened instantly using keyboard shortcuts, allowing for a seamless and efficient browsing experience without leaving the main dashboard view.


  Customization is one of the key aspects of ThinkDashboard. It includes a flexible theme system that allows users to adjust colors, fonts, and layouts to match their personal style. The design is fully responsive and automatically adapts to different screen sizes, providing a smooth experience on computers, tablets, and mobile devices. This makes ThinkDashboard both practical and visually appealing for everyday use.


  All data is stored locally in simple JSON files, including bookmarks, theme configurations, and user preferences. By keeping everything on the local system, ThinkDashboard ensures complete privacy and independence from cloud services or external databases. Users have full ownership of their information and can easily back it up or move it between systems.


  In essence, ThinkDashboard delivers an elegant and lightweight solution for building a personal homepage that is fast, intuitive, and entirely customizable. It transforms daily web navigation into a clear and organized process for anyone who values simplicity, design, and control.

releaseNotes: >-
  This update adds a full backup feature that allows users to export and import their entire data directory directly from the interface. Backups can now be created and restored through the configuration page, making it much easier to manage and safeguard personal data.


  It also introduces hash-based navigation for faster access to specific sections within the settings and brings a few small visual refinements to the interface.


  Future plans include adding SSO authentication, multi-user support, and the ability to import data from other bookmark management tools.
