  🗒️ Glass Keep is a beautifully designed note taking application that brings a calm and modern experience to organizing thoughts and ideas. It features a clean glassmorphic interface inspired by Google Keep, creating a smooth and elegant environment for writing and creativity.


  It allows users to create, edit, and manage notes with ease. Each note can contain rich text, checklists, and markdown formatting, offering flexibility for anything from quick reminders to detailed reflections. Notes can be color coded and tagged to keep information neatly structured and personalized.


  Images can be added directly to notes, allowing users to visually enrich their thoughts or capture moments of inspiration. Pinned notes stay at the top, making sure that important information is always visible and easy to access.


  Users can edit notes inline, archive older ones for later reference, or delete them permanently when they are no longer needed. A powerful search and filter system ensures that even large collections of notes remain easy to navigate and organize.


  With its responsive and minimal design, Glass Keep feels fluid and pleasant to use on any device. Whether writing a long journal entry, managing a to do list, or collecting creative ideas, it combines simplicity, clarity, and elegance to make note taking both productive and enjoyable.
