  🚗 LubeLogger is a vehicle management application designed to help users keep a complete and accurate history of their vehicles. It allows detailed tracking of maintenance, repairs, and regular service activities so that every oil change, inspection, or part replacement is documented in one place. Over time, this creates a clear record of how a vehicle has been cared for and what work has been performed.


  The app also focuses heavily on fuel tracking and cost analysis. Users can record fuel fill ups, mileage, and prices, which enables precise calculations of fuel consumption and long term efficiency. Based on this data, LubeLogger provides insights into running costs and trends, making it easier to understand how driving habits or vehicle condition affect expenses.


  Another core function is expense and cost management. LubeLogger lets users categorize and review all vehicle related costs, including maintenance, fuel, and other recurring or one time expenses. This makes it simple to see how much a vehicle costs to own over months or years and to compare costs between multiple vehicles.


  LubeLogger includes planning and reminder features that help users stay on top of upcoming maintenance tasks. Service intervals can be tracked based on time or mileage, ensuring that important work is not forgotten. This helps improve vehicle reliability and can extend the lifespan of the vehicle through timely care.


  The application also supports managing multiple vehicles and organizing all related data in a structured and searchable way. Documents such as receipts or service records can be attached to entries, creating a complete digital archive for each vehicle. Overall, LubeLogger is built to give vehicle owners full visibility into maintenance history, fuel usage, and total cost of ownership in a clear and practical manner.

releaseNotes: >-
  This version focuses on improving overall stability and reliability of the application. Several bugs were fixed, including issues with exporting records that contained images in notes and a limitation that prevented configuring fewer than six visible tabs.


  User and account management was enhanced by adding a confirm password field during root user setup and introducing user households, which allow vehicles to be inherited and shared more flexibly between users.


  Usability and integration capabilities were also expanded. The garage context menu now displays tabs in the order defined by the user configuration, and the API was extended with new endpoints for supply records as well as endpoints to retrieve all records across all vehicles.


  In addition, logging was improved by adding more detailed information for JWT validation errors when using OIDC, making authentication related issues easier to diagnose.
