  🧩 Decypharr is an open source application written in Go that acts as a qBittorrent compatible API while integrating support for popular Debrid services such as Real Debrid, All Debrid, Torbox and Debrid Link. It is designed for seamless integration with automation tools like Sonarr, Radarr and Lidarr which can interact with it as if it were a standard qBittorrent client. This allows users to automate the process of downloading torrents through their premium Debrid accounts without needing to run a traditional torrent client or maintain their own seedbox.


  The core functionality of Decypharr centers on intercepting torrent and magnet links from the connected automation tools and passing them to the configured Debrid services. These services handle the torrent download on their own infrastructure and provide direct download links which Decypharr then manages locally. The software includes a simple and functional web user interface that gives users the ability to monitor and manage the status of their downloads.


  In addition to its API compatibility and Debrid integration Decypharr offers a built in WebDAV server for accessing downloaded files as well as a symlink manager that ensures files are correctly linked for media library updates. It also includes repair workers that check for missing or broken symlinks and automatically correct them providing a reliable experience especially when dealing with large automated libraries. Decypharr is actively maintained and offers a modern alternative to older tools like Zurg by combining speed simplicity and advanced features such as WebDAV and symlink repair in a single solution.
