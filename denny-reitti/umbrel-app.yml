  🗺️ Reitti is an application designed to monitor and record your movements in a comprehensive and automated way. It continuously tracks your location throughout the day and identifies the places you visit, creating a detailed log of your daily activities. By analyzing your movements, it can detect the mode of transportation you use, whether you are walking, cycling, or driving, and provides insights into how you travel between different locations.


  The app also identifies significant places that you frequently visit and allows you to assign custom names to them, helping you better understand the locations that matter most in your life. It organizes this information into an interactive timeline that shows when and for how long you stayed at each place, as well as the distances traveled between them. This timeline gives a clear overview of your daily routines and patterns.


  Reitti offers detailed visualizations of your complete travel paths using precise GPS data. These visual representations make it easy to see your movement habits, recurring routes, and overall mobility trends. By providing these insights, the app helps users gain a deeper understanding of their personal travel behaviors, the places they frequent, and the way they navigate their daily environment.


  Overall, Reitti focuses on giving users a comprehensive picture of their mobility patterns and the spatial context of their daily life, turning raw location data into meaningful information about how they move and interact with their surroundings.


  ⚙️ After starting the application, the first step is to generate an API token in the Settings under API Tokens, which is needed for mobile app integration. Next, geocoding services should be added in Settings under Geocoding to enable accurate address resolution. You can then import your existing location data through Settings under Import Data. Finally, configure mobile apps such as OwnTracks or GPSLogger to enable real-time tracking of your movements.
