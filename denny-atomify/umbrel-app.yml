  ðŸŒŒ Atmoify is a web-based ambient sound generator designed to help you create a personal atmosphere for focus, relaxation, or sleep. It offers a clean and intuitive interface where users can blend various audio sources into a seamless sound experience. One of its core features is the ability to play YouTube videos in audio-only mode, allowing for an endless selection of background music, nature sounds, or white noise without the distraction of visuals. In addition to YouTube integration, Atmoify includes a collection of built-in ambient effects such as rain, wind, fireplace, or ocean waves, which can be layered and individually adjusted in volume.


  The application lets you create and save custom sound profiles, making it easy to return to your preferred soundscape anytime. A built-in timer allows you to set a duration for playback, which is especially useful for work sessions, meditation, or falling asleep. With its focus on simplicity and mood-enhancing audio, Atmoify offers a peaceful, distraction-free space tailored to your needs.
