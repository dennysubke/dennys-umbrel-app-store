  ðŸ¦‰ ExpenseOwl is a simple and focused expense tracking application that allows users to quickly log and review their financial activity. It supports adding income and expenses with just a date, amount, and category, while also offering optional tags for further organization. The app provides a clean and responsive user interface with both light and dark themes, making it easy to navigate and visually appealing.


  The main dashboard features a monthly pie chart that breaks down expenses by category, along with a cashflow summary that shows total income, total expenses, and the resulting balance. Users can interact with the chart by hiding or showing categories to tailor the view. A detailed table lists all transactions chronologically and supports easy searching and deletion.


  Recurring transactions are supported for both income and expenses, and users can fully customize their categories, currency symbol, and the starting day of each month. Tags are automatically highlighted when used, helping users identify spending patterns. The app also includes CSV import and export functionality for easy data management.


  ExpenseOwl is designed to give a clear and instant overview of personal finances without the distractions of budgeting features or account management. It focuses entirely on fast, straightforward tracking and clean visualization.
