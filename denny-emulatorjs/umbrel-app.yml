  🎮 EmulatorJS is a web-based software platform that allows users to play retro video games directly in their browser. It works by emulating classic gaming consoles using JavaScript, making it possible to run old-school games without the need for additional software or plugins. The emulator is designed to be lightweight and efficient, providing smooth gameplay for a wide range of classic systems.


  It supports loading ROM files locally or from a server, enabling users to either play their own legally obtained game backups or host libraries of games for personal use. EmulatorJS includes features such as save states, controller support, and fullscreen mode, creating an experience that closely mimics the original hardware.


  Its versatility and ease of use make it an appealing choice for enthusiasts who want to relive the nostalgia of classic games or build their own web-based retro gaming platforms. As an open-source project, it is freely available and can be customized or self-hosted, offering full control over the look, feel, and functionality of the emulator environment.
