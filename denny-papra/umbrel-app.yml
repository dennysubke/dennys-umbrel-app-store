  ðŸ“„ Papra is an open-source document management platform designed to help individuals, startups, and businesses organize and securely store their documents in a centralized location. The platform aims to simplify document handling by offering an intuitive interface where users can upload, categorize, and search their files easily.


  One of the standout features of Papra is its email integration, which provides users with a unique email address that automatically saves email attachments as documents within the system. This makes it effortless to keep important files without manual uploading. Papra also supports tagging, allowing users to label documents with relevant keywords to improve organization and make retrieval faster. The search functionality is powerful and enables users to quickly find the documents they need among large collections.


  The application is currently in its beta phase but already offers a stable core experience with ongoing active development and frequent updates. Users interested in trying the platform can access a live demo, and those who prefer more control can host the application themselves following available documentation and guides.


  Papra is community-driven and encourages contributions and feedback to continuously enhance its features and usability. Overall, Papra provides a practical and efficient solution for managing digital documents with a focus on simplicity, automation, and security.
