releaseNotes: >-
  This update introduces keyboard shortcuts to switch between companies quickly and enhances contact search by address. Error messages are now clearer, allowing users to provide technical details more easily, and the error debugging menu provides direct access to underlying models.


  The editor has been improved to support numbered and bulleted lists using shortcuts, and suggested command buttons now appear in tooltips for a smoother editing experience. On mobile, the editor toolbar has been optimized, and records can be filtered directly within apps using the new search field.


  Additional enhancements include the installation of specific Progressive Web Apps for features like barcode scanning, point of sale, attendance, kiosks, check-in counters, and workshops. The Gantt view now supports endless horizontal scrolling, image import via the import tool has been improved, and list column width calculations are more accurate.


  Security and usability have also been upgraded with passkey authentication using the webauthn protocol, readable URLs for easier navigation and editing, the ability to re-trigger searches from the search bar, and updated user tours that can be enabled or disabled from the user menu.
