  🕶️ AnonAddy is an open-source email forwarding service that allows users to protect their privacy by creating anonymous email aliases. It helps users manage their online presence while avoiding spam, data breaches, and unwanted tracking. Instead of using a personal email address, users can generate unique aliases for different websites and services. Emails sent to these aliases are automatically forwarded to the user’s real inbox without revealing their actual email address.


  The platform offers several features, including PGP encryption for secure email forwarding, the ability to reply anonymously to messages, and support for custom domains. Users can also deactivate or delete aliases at any time to prevent further communication. This makes AnonAddy a powerful tool for maintaining privacy and security while interacting online.


  The service operates on a subscription-based model with a free tier that includes limited aliases, while premium plans offer additional features like unlimited aliases, custom domains, and increased bandwidth. Self-hosting options are also available, allowing users to run their own instance of AnonAddy for complete control over their email forwarding.


  ⚠️ Note: It is recommended to set up a custom domain for sending emails. Additionally, SPF and DKIM TXT records must be properly configured in the DNS settings. Without these adjustments, email delivery issues may occur, especially with Gmail.
