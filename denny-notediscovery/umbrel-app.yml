  📄 NoteDiscovery is a lightweight and flexible knowledge tool designed to create, edit and organize notes in a clean and intuitive way. It focuses entirely on the writing and thinking process by using plain text and Markdown so that every note remains simple, readable and easy to structure. The editor provides real time previews for text, code and formulas, which makes it suitable for technical documentation, study notes or personal writing. Notes can reference each other through wikilinks, allowing you to build interconnected knowledge structures and navigate them quickly.


  The application supports diagrams, mathematical notation and syntax highlighted code blocks, giving you a broad range of expressive tools inside a minimal interface. Tags and frontmatter metadata help categorize and filter content, while templates make it easy to create repeatable structures for recurring note types. Images and attachments can be added to any note, and the visual layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes so the writing experience stays consistent.


  NoteDiscovery aims to give you a calm and distraction free environment where your notes remain fully accessible in plain text and where your knowledge grows through simple connections between documents. Its design encourages clarity, long term organization and freedom from proprietary formats, making it a reliable companion for personal knowledge management.
