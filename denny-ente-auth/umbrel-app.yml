  🔐 Ente Auth is the authentication service that powers Ente, a privacy-focused photo backup and synchronization platform. It handles user management, including registration, login, password recovery, and token generation, serving as the gateway through which users access their encrypted data. The service ensures secure authentication processes by implementing robust encryption mechanisms, thereby protecting user credentials and maintaining the integrity of the login process. Designed with privacy as a core principle, Ente Auth operates in a way that even Ente itself cannot access user data, as all content is encrypted end-to-end. This architecture ensures that while the service manages authentication and access control, it never compromises the confidentiality of the stored media. By maintaining strict security protocols and encryption standards, Ente Auth provides a seamless yet secure user experience that aligns with the broader mission of Ente to prioritize data privacy and user control.
