  🍵 Peppermint is a ticket management and helpdesk application that helps teams organize and respond to support requests in a structured and efficient way. It collects incoming messages, usually from email, and automatically turns them into individual tickets that can be tracked, assigned, and updated as the conversation continues. Each ticket keeps the full history of replies, attachments, and internal notes, allowing support agents to see the entire context of an issue at a glance and respond with confidence.


  Teams can communicate directly with users through the ticket interface while also discussing matters privately using internal comments. Tickets can be given a status such as open, pending, or resolved, and can be assigned to specific team members for accountability. The system groups and sorts tickets by various criteria like date or status, making it easy to prioritize work and prevent important issues from being overlooked.


  Peppermint also includes tagging and filtering tools so teams can categorize tickets and find related cases quickly. Its search function makes it easy to locate previous conversations or track ongoing issues over time. The interface is clean and designed to keep the focus on the support task itself without adding unnecessary complexity or distractions.


  The application works with existing email addresses and can automatically convert incoming emails into tickets. When a support agent replies inside the app, the response is sent back to the original sender by email, and their reply will be captured as part of the ongoing ticket. This creates a seamless flow between the user and the support team without requiring any special setup from the user’s side.


  Peppermint helps teams stay organized, improves the speed and quality of responses, and provides a clear and simple system for handling support interactions from start to finish.
